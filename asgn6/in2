I will contribute a desire to help others. During my first year at UC Santa Cruz I realized that I really enjoy helping others understand difficult concepts. My first quarter I took an online calculus class, Math 19b, and I enrolled in a program called ACE that helps students succeed in certain classes. Most of the material in this class was review for me since I had taken calculus in high school. At the weekly ACE review sessions I noticed that a lot of my peers would struggle. Many of my table partners would ask me for help on problems and I would gladly help. One kid in particular would frequently ask me for help and I tried my best to help him understand, often explaining the same concept a couple times in different ways to see what stuck. During a review session for an upcoming quiz we were told to finish a practice quiz. I sat with him and helped him with questions he got wrong until he felt that he was ready to take the quiz. At the next session he came to me smiling and expressed his gratitude for my help and showed me his grade. He had gotten a B+. I felt really happy that I was able to help him and from then on I made sure to ask my group partners if they needed help, especially if I saw them struggling on a problem. This made me want to become a tutor for one of my coding classes in the future. I hope to be a tutor for my Java data structures class, which I am currently taking. If I am accepted I will contribute my love for helping others learn.
