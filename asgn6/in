I want to be a Code2040 fellow because I have found a passion for coding. I have always been
the type of person who liked solving puzzles. As a kid I remember enjoying my time building
wooden tonka trucks. Wanting more of a challenge, Iâ€™d throw away the instructions to see if I
could build the truck without them.
